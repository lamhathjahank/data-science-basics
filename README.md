data Science Basics:
Topics:
● Overview of data science and the data science pipeline
● Types of data (structured, unstructured)
● Basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
● Data wrangling and cleaning
● Introduction to data visualization

Step 1: Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyse large amounts of data.
Data Science pipeline:  A pipeline in data science is “a set of actions which changes the raw (and confusing) data from various sources (surveys, feedbacks, list of purchases, votes, etc.), to an understandable format so that we can store it and use it for analysis.”

Step 2:  Structured data:  This data is organized in a fixed format, usually in tables with rows and columns. Structured data is often quantitative, meaning it's objective and can be easily counted, measured, and expressed in numbers. Examples of structured data include customer contact information, such as names, addresses, and phone numbers.  Unstructured data:  This data doesn't have a pre-defined structure and can come in many different forms, such as audio and video files, large text documents, emails, and social media posts. Unstructured data is often qualitative, meaning it's subjective and interpretive.

Step 3:  The mean, median, mode, and standard deviation are all basic statistical values that describe the central tendency of a set of data. Mean:  The average of all the values in a data set. It's calculated by adding all the numbers in the data set and dividing by the number of values. Median:  The middle value in a data set when ordered from least to greatest. Half of the values in the data set are below the median, and half are above it.  Mode:  The value that occurs most frequently in a data set. If all values are unique, there is no mode.  Standard deviation:  A measure of how much variation there is around the mean. A low standard deviation means the data are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation means the data are spread out.
 
Step 4:  Data cleaning:  The process of making sure data is accurate and consistent. Data cleaning focuses on removing inaccurate data from a data set.  Data wrangling:  The process of manipulating data to make it usable for analysis. Data wrangling focuses on transforming the data's format, typically by converting “raw” data into another format.

Step 5:  Data visualization:  data visualization  is the visual or graphical representation of data , data  visualization is the process of representing data using visual  elements like charts,graphs,or maps. It makes  complex data easier to understand  and process by converting it into a visual representation.
 
Activities:
1. Use Python libraries (like Pandas and Matplotlib) to load, clean, and visualize a simple dataset.
2. Calculate basic statistics on the dataset.
3. Practice creating different types of visualizations (histograms, line plots, scatter plots).
4. Recommended resources: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib documentation, beginner-level Data                   

Step 1: Load, Clean, and Visualize a Dataset 1:- Loading the Dataset: We load the dataset and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure .2:- Cleaning the Dataset:
Check for any missing or inconsistent values and handle them if necessary.3:- Initial Visualization: Visualize some basic aspects of the dataset to get an understanding of its distribution

Step 2: With the dataset loaded and cleaned, let's calculate some basic statistics: Mean, median, and standard deviation for the numerical columns.  Mode for categorical columns.

Step 3:  Create Different Types of Visualizations: We’ll create a few basic visualizations to understand our data further: 1.Histogram - Show the distribution of the total bill. 2. Line Plot - Track changes in total bill across the dataset. 3. Scatter Plot - Show the relationship between total bill and tip.

Step 4:  Pandas Documentation, NumPy
