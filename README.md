  Understanding the Internet (Start to Backend)
Topics:
● Basic Internet architecture (IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS)
● Understanding client-server model
● HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
● Overview of APIs and RESTful services
● Overview of backends, servers, and databases

Step 1:  The basic internet architecture includes the Internet Protocol (IP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure version, HTTPS: Internet Protocol (IP):  IP is a network layer protocol that delivers packets from a source host to a destination host. IP addresses are used to label the packets with source and destination information. Domain Name System (DNS):  DNS is a protocol that resolves domain names. When a user enters a domain name, DNS servers work together to answer the request and provide the IP address needed to access the website.  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):  HTTP is a protocol that allows users to access websites by connecting to the domain's server and requesting the HTML code for the page. HTTPS (HTTP Secure):  HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts a user's HTTP requests and webpages. This helps prevent cybersecurity threats.

Step 2:  The client-server model is a network architecture where a client requests information or services from a server, which then responds. It's a fundamental concept for understanding how data is exchanged over a network.  

Step 3:  HTTP methods: GET:  Retrieves data from a server.  POST: Creates new resources on a server.  PUT:  Updates or replaces an existing resource on a server. DELETE: Removes a resource from a server.

Step 4:  API, or application programming interface, is a way for two software programs to communicate with each other. A RESTful API is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. RESTful APIs are based on the representational state transfer (REST) architectural style, which is a common standard for web

Step 5:  Backend services and databases are components of an application that store, process, and manage data: Backend services  Also known as server-side services, these manage the functionality and data of an application. They include tasks like processing user requests, storing and retrieving data, and managing security and performance. Backend services communicate with the front end of an application through APIs.  Backend databases:  Store and manage data for the backend of an application

ACTIVITIES:
1. Study HTTP request and response structures using your browser’s developer tools.
2. Explore REST APIs like JSON Placeholder to understand GET/POST requests.
3. Create simple HTTP requests using Python’s requests library.
4. Recommended resources:  MDN Web Docs (on HTTP and APIs), freeCodeCamp tutorials. 

Step 1:  Study HTTP Request and Response Structures Using Your Browser's Developer Tools: 1. Open Developer Tools:  In most browsers, open Developer Tools by pressing F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) / Cmd + Option + I (Mac). Go to the Network tab.  2. Inspect a Request.  3. Inspect a Response: -  Click on the Response tab to view the server’s response content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or an image file).

Step 2:  Explore REST APIs Like JSON Placeholder to Understand GET/POST Requests: 1. GET Requests,  2.  POST Requests : POST requests to /posts for creating a new post. 

Step 3:   Create Simple HTTP Requests Using Python’s Requests Library:  We can use Python’s requests library to make GET and POST requests. 1.  GET Request : We’ll use requests. Get() to retrieve data from JSON Placeholder.  2. POST Request We can use requests. Post() to create a new post. 

Step 4:  MDN Web Docs on HTTP, google,
