 Introduction to Flask and Basic Backend Concepts:
 Topics:
● Introduction to Flask and how it works
● Setting up a basic Flask application
● Routing in Flask: handling GET and POST requests
● Creating a simple REST API endpoint

Step 1:  Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework for web development and web applications that utilizes the Python programming language.  Flask is a python web framework that works by handling requests, routing them to the appropriate view function, and generating a response.

Step 2:  A basic Flask application is a web application built using the Flask web framework in Python: Flask A lightweight Python framework that offers tools and features for building web applications. Flask is a micro-framework, meaning it doesn't include features like database abstraction, authentication, and form validation.

Step 3:  routing is the technique used to map the specific URL with the associated function intended to perform some task.  Handling request methods in Flask routes:- The GET method is used to retrieve information from the server. The POST method is used to submit data to the server and the DELETE method is used to delete data from the server.

Step 4:  A REST endpoint is a URL that allows access to a specific resource and its associated data in a RESTful API. create a simple RESTful API endpoint:-  Set up your environment: Install Node.js and npm, and create a new project . Install dependencies: Install Express, body-parser, and cors.  Create a server: Create a file named server.js to implement the API code.  Define endpoints and HTTP methods:- : Use the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to define endpoints for reading, creating, updating, and deleting data. Test your API:- Run your API on your local system and test it with Postman.

Activities:
1. Install Flask and set up a basic project.
2. Create simple routes (/hello, /user/<name>) to handle different requests.
3. Implement a simple REST API with Flask (e.g., return data from a dictionary or list).
4. Recommended resources: Flask documentation, Flask for Beginners tutorials on YouTube.

Step 1:  1. Install Flask  2. Create a Basic Flask Project Structure: , create a file called app.py  3. Basic Flask App Code: Add the code in app.py to set up a simple Flask application. 4. Run the Flask App.

Step 2:  Create Simple Routes (/hello, /user/<name>):- 1.  Add a /hello Route:  Add a route to display a simple greeting.  2. Add a Dynamic Route /user/<name>:  This route will accept a name parameter from the URL and respond with a personalized greeting. 3. Test the Routes

Step 3:  Implement a Simple REST API with Flask: This API will include: A route to get all items. A route to get a specific item by ID. A route to add a new item (using POST). 1. Sample Data Structure:-  Let’s create a sample dataset as a dictionary.  2. Endpoints Create the REST API:- GET /items: Return all items. GET /items/ Return a specific item by ID. POST /items: Add a new item. 3. Test the REST API.
