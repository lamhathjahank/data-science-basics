Day 1: Introduction to Git
Activities: 
1. Install Git and set up a GitHub account.
2. Create a local repository, make some commits, and push to a GitHub repository.
3. Practice branching, making changes on different branches, and merging them.
4. Recommended resources: Git documentation and beginner tutorials on GitHub.

Step 1:  Install Git, For Windows:1 Download the Installer:(Go to the Git for Windows website.) 2 Run the Installer:(Locate the downloaded .exe file and run it.)3.Verify installation: open terminal (or Command prompt on windows)and type:
 Set Up a GitHub Account:(1.Create an account 2.Sign Up 3.Choose a Username 4.Create a Password 5. Choose a Plan 6. Set Up Preferences 7.Complete Registration)

Step 2: Creating a local repository: Open a Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt (or Git Bash if you're on Windows),Create a New Repository Fill in Repository Details:(Choose a local path where you want to save the repository on your computer. Optionally, check “Initialize this repository with a README” to create an initial README file). Create the Repository:make some commits: 1. Navigate to Local Repository:(Open terminal or command prompt, and navigate to project folder:) 2. Make Changes to Files:(Add or edit files in project directory.) 3. Stage the Changes:(After making changes, need to stage them with the git add command. Staging prepares the changes for the next commit.) 4. Create a Commit:(After starting commits' Each commit saves a snapshot of the chanches, and the message helps explain what those changes are about.)
push to a GitHub repository: means uploading local changes from a Git repository on computer to a remote repository hosted on GitHub. This is typically done after vee created a local repository 

step 3: Practise branching: the process of creating,managingand working with branches in a git repository . this is commonly used in collaborative development to isolate changes different versions of a project without affecting the main codebase

Topics:
● What is Git and why version control matters
● Setting up Git and basic Git commands
● Git workflows: cloning, staging, committing, and pushing
● Branching and merging basics
● Using GitHub for remote collaboration

Step 1:  Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, ensuring that their changes don't conflict with each other. Version control is important because it helps track changes to files, code, and other digital assets, which can help teams work more efficiently and productively.

Step 2:  Setting up Git involves using Git commands to customize Git's functionality and optimize it for workflow. Git commands:  Git add :- The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.  Git init :-  The git init command creates a new Git repository  
Git push:- The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
Git Pull :- The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

Step 3:  A Git workflow is a set of guidelines for using Git to manage code, organize changes, and structure branches. Cloning:- git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location. Staging:- is a file, generally contained in the  git directory, that  stores information about what will go into the next commit. Committing:-  Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time. Pushing:- The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

Step 4: Branching and merging are essential concepts in Git that help teams collaborate on projects and manage code changes. Branching:- Create a separate copy of the code to work on a new feature, bug fix, or experiment. Merging:- Combine changes from one branch into another to create a single version of the code.

Step 5:  sinc GitHub for remote collaboration involves leveraging its features to manage code repositories, track changes, and facilitate teamwork.
